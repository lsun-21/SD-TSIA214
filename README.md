Machine Learning for Text Mining 

Text Mining: Methods and Techniques

Text mining is an evolving and challenging field that involves extracting valuable insights and information from textual data. One significant area of focus in recent times has been the analysis of opinion data available on social media platforms. This course aims to address the various methods of language processing and machine learning that underlie text and opinion mining.

Key techniques and concepts covered in this course include:

Natural language pre-processing:
- Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual tokens (words, phrases, or symbols).
- Part-of-speech tagging: Assigning grammatical tags to words based on their context and role in a sentence.
- Document representation: Techniques for representing text documents numerically for machine learning algorithms.
- Word embeddings techniques: Methods for representing words as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space.
Natural language resources:
- Lexicons: Dictionaries or vocabularies that provide information about words, such as sentiment or semantic meaning.
- WordNet: A lexical database that groups words into sets of synonyms and provides hierarchical relationships between them.
- FrameNet: A knowledge base that captures the relationship between words and the frames (situations or scenarios) they are associated with.
Text clustering and text categorization:
- Advanced machine learning methods, including:
- Deep learning: Techniques that utilize neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns and representations from text data.
- Non-negative matrix factorization: A method for extracting meaningful features from high-dimensional data.
- Hidden Markov models: Probabilistic models used for sequential data analysis, such as text.
These topics will provide a solid foundation for understanding and applying text mining techniques in various domains.
